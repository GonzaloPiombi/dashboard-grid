# Admin Dashboard

### Final project of the intermediate HTML and CSS course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

The goal of the project was to recreate a layout resembling what an admin dashboard looks like using primarily CSS Grid. 

[Live Demo](https://gonzalopiombi.github.io/dashboard-grid/) (It does not mean to be fully responsive).
